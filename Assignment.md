## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes ðŸ˜…).
For each one, mention:

What you thought it would be like **(Expectation ðŸ‘€)**

What you actually learned **(Reality ðŸ˜…)**

And how it helped with your personal portfolio project ðŸ’»

make it honestâ€”and if it surprised you, even better!


**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**

**1. Concept: Creating milestones and issues**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I didn't necessarily know what to expect as I never knew what the purpose for those 2 were. I thought they were decorations.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out milestones and issues help you track your work and creater better order in workflow allowing you to know which task is needed of you. 

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I created milestones that helped me stay in track while doing the project giving me ease in workflow.

**2. Concept: Merging Branches**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I expected to know how to merge branches with ease to stop worrying about working on different branches

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: I't turned out to be an easy process and now I can do it with ease

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I was able to work on different branches confidently without having to worry about merge conflicts as I was confident that if I encountered any, I would easily solve them.


**3. Concept: Deploying on github pages**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought it would be a tideous process that required so many things

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out it is actually very simple and you can easily do this hence making websites and hosting doesn't look impossible anymore

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I was able to deploy my portfolio with ease and what a smooth process it was.

**4. Concept: Creating Project board**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I didn't necessarily know what to expect here. 

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Found it facinating and a good way to see which issues are at what stage of development

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I't made it easy for me to track which issues were at what stage and also trac what was in progress making keeping track of my workflow easier.

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features
